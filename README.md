# League-of-legends-API-testing
Basic testing of Riot Games API with emphasis on League of Legends

Note: Requires own API key! Acquired on https://developer.riotgames.com/ api key is currently loaded from a variable called "apikey", due to safety reasons, it is not included in the files! Please head over to above specified website to acquire your own, or ask me to show it over screen share.

Current functionality: Ability to search a player through their Summoner Name(In game name), and it then uses that to fetch information through Riot Games API, and then displays some information, including level, rank, and current points.
